# Properties

title: Tetra Chromatic Stimulator - An OpenSource LED stimulator for visual and optogenetics stimulation in combination with 2-photon recordings.   # required | text | A title to identify the thing

description: |
    Here we describe an effective, low-cost, opensource LED stimulator, designed to be used in combination with a 2-photon microscope. The design is built around an open-source development board and off-the-shelf components. It has been conceived to be assembled and used without the need for advanced electronics skills.
